The important task in data mining is the classification of the data into the predefined groups or classes. One of the commonly used classifier technique is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) [1]. Although ANN usually reaches high classification accuracy, the obtained results sometimes may be incomprehensible [2]. Due to this fact various methods have been proposed to extract the rules from ANN which justifies the classification results given by ANN. For this the trained neural network is pruned for removing the inputs that are not needed for solving the problem. The pruned network serves to filter noise that might be present in the data [2]. The proposed research work shall be based on extracting optimized the rules from ANN which justifies the classification results given by ANN.}
